I have handled this project from designing to executing the interior as well as the layout of a Chartered Accountant’s Office. Here are some key points that crossed my mind while designing this office. An Interior Designer should understand the taste and liking of the client and should combine them with their profession. </p> <img src=${blog_ca_2_image} class='blog-img' alt='interior-designing'/> <p>The world map on the shows the interest and personality of the client. It also inspires and motivates everyone to make good name is this small world. I have selected simple and peaceful colours which are white and gray, keeping the world map colorful and attractive space to be showcased. White and gray colors are also recognized as professional colors. This world map is placed in the line of sight so that every person who enters this office will look at it atleast once.</p><img src=${blog_ca_3_image} class='blog-img' alt='interior-designing'/> <p>Next comes the CA’s logo which is universal so we cannot make much changes on it. So we didn’t change the theme of CA’s logo. We used 'Acrylic' material to make the logo we didn’t even change the color of the CA’s logo. We did some minor add-on to the logo by increasing the thickness of some portions of the logo. So when light is cast upon it perpendicularly then it looks like a 3D logo and then we installed a light bulb perpendicular to the logo and hurray there goes our 3D effect.</p><img src=${blog_ca_4_image} class='blog-img' alt='interior-designing'/> <p>Other aspects that I usually follow is space optimisation considering the fact that all the employees in the office have enough space so that they feel comfortable. This helps all the employees to stay focused, it also aims at developing overall wellness, boosting morale and cultivating happiness from top-level to lower-level executives. We have kept wide open windows so that good amount of sunlight and natural air passes in and out of the office. Bounded space seems to offer openness a sense of spaciousness. Each area flows to the nest space and some common elements to various rooms together. All the partitions in this office are made by glass which shows modern and international style and we have added film on the glass to provide some privacy. The glass partition helps light to pass easily through it and thus illuminates the room even at minimum lighting. <p> So these see my thoughts and views from my C.A (Chartered Accounts) project. Please feel free to ask questions and give suggestions art.idesignspace@gmail.com</p ></p > </p ></div > `,
